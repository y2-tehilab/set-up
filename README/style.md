## Style:

- Install scss:

  ```bash
  yarn add sass
  ```

  then change all css files to scss, and don't forget to change also the imports.

- Optional - Install styled-components for the style of the project:
  ```bash
  yarn add styled-components
  ```
  rename `styles/Home.module.scss` to `index.module.scss` and move it to `pages` folder, and don't forget to change also the imports.
